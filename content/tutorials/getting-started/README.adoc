// Purpose statement for the assembly
[role="_abstract"]
As a developer of applications and services, you can use the {product-long} cloud service to create and set up Kafka instances and connect your applications and services to these instances. {product} is a cloud service that enables you to implement Kafka data-streaming functionality in your applications without having to install, configure, run, and maintain your own Kafka clusters.

.Prerequisites
ifndef::community[]
* You have a Red Hat account.
endif::[]
//* You have a subscription to {product-long}. For more information about signing up, see *<@SME: Where to link?>*.
* You have access to an application or service that you want to connect to a Kafka instance in {product-long}.

// Condition out QS-only content so that it doesn't appear in docs.
// All QS anchor IDs must be in this alternate anchor ID format `[#anchor-id]` because the ascii splitter relies on the other format `[id="anchor-id"]` to generate module files.

[#description]
Learn how to create and set up your first Apache Kafka instance in {product-long}.

[#introduction]
Welcome to the {product-long} Getting Started quick start. In this quick start, you'll learn how to create and inspect a Kafka instance, create a service account to connect an application or service to the instance, and create a topic in the instance.

[id="con-product-overview_{context}"]
== {product-long}

{product-long} is a fully managed cloud service running on https://www.openshift.com/products/dedicated/[OpenShift Dedicated]. {product} enables you to implement Kafka data-streaming functionality in your applications without having to install, configure, run, and maintain your own Kafka clusters. With {product}, you can share data between microservices and other applications with high throughput and low latency.

{product} also has the following key attributes:

* *Scales with your application needs*: As your applications and services grow and require more Kafka instances, topics, and data, {product} can scale to meet those needs.
* *Provides flexible user control*: You can use the {product} web console UI or the relevant {product} API to configure the service as you desire.
ifndef::community[]
* *Offers a Service Level Agreement (SLA)*: You can rely on the service functionality as defined in the SLA.

[id="proc-creating-kafka-instance_{context}"]
== Creating a Kafka instance in {product}

A Kafka instance in {product} includes a Kafka cluster, bootstrap server, and other required configurations for connecting to Kafka producer and consumer services. You can use the {product} web console to create and configure a Kafka instance for your applications or services.

ifndef::qs[]
.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to the {product} web console at {service-url}.
endif::[]

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Is the new Kafka instance listed in the instances table?
* Is the state of the new Kafka instance shown as *Ready*?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
. Verify that the new Kafka instance is listed in the instances table.
. Verify that the state of the new Kafka instance is shown as *Ready*.

// Commenting out the following for now, which belongs in an onboarding tour (Stetson, 4 March 2021)

When you're in the {Product_short} environment, you will see a left menu panel. This panel provides access to all resources related to the service, including the `Quick Starts` and `Documentation`.

In the lower left of the screen you'll see a lightbulb icon. This icon gives access to the `Resource Center`. Here you can find the latest information about the service, like product updates, upcoming events, etc.

The center of the page shows you the list of Kafka instances that are currently running within your organisation. If this is your, or your organisations, first interaction with {Product_short}, this list will be empty.

[id="proc-creating-service-account_{context}"]
== Creating a service account to connect to a Kafka instance in {product}

To connect your applications or services to a Kafka instance in the {product} web console, you must create a service account, copy and save the generated credentials, and copy and save the bootstrap server location. {product-long} uses the SASL/OAUTHBEARER authentication mechanism over TLS to provide secure connections between your applications and Kafka instances. SASL/PLAIN authentication is also available for tools and libraries that do not support SASL/OAUTHBEARER, but SASL/OAUTHBEARER is recommended whenever possible. When you generate credentials for a Kafka instance, {product} creates a service account that contains the generated user name and password associated with the instance.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a Kafka instance in the {product} web console and the instance is in *Ready* state.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Did you save the bootstrap server endpoint to a secure location?
* Did you save the client credentials to a secure location?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
. Verify that the bootstrap server endpoint is saved to a secure location.
. Verify that the client credentials are saved to a secure location.
endif::[]

[id="proc-creating-kafka-topic_{context}"]
== Creating a Kafka topic in {product}

After you create a Kafka instance, you can create Kafka topics to start producing and consuming messages in your services.

.Prerequisites
* You have created a Kafka instance in the {product} web console and the instance is in *Ready* state.

.Verification
ifdef::qs[]
* Is the new Kafka topic listed in the topics table?
endif::[]
ifndef::qs[]
* Verify that the new Kafka topic is listed in the topics table.
endif::[]

[#conclusion]
Congratulations! You successfully completed the {product} Getting Started quick start, and are now ready to use the service.
